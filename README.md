This folder contains Google Takeout for location as of January 2023.

I tried to get a complete list of times I was at the clinic.  

The "raw" Records.json is large, but doesn't have everything.  I confirmed by looking at a day I *knew* I was at the clinic based on a phot I took there.  I exported using the "location_history_json_converter.py" script to kml.  It doesn't even show getting close to the clinic.  Very noisy and incomplete.


The Semantic... folder is interesting, it is divided by years.  It's also incomplete and doesnt have the date I was looking for, so I don't trust it.

Future me:  Clean up the Semantic one, and call it a best guess.
